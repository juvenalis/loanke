# Predicting Loan approval using deep  Neural Network:

![home_loan](images/home_loan.jpg)

### The Problem Domain
This is a tool to predict loan eligibility in real time for the unbanked population most common in african countries. Customer first apply for the loan by providing the necessary details that include Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents,Applicant Income, Co-Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others, after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.
 

### Required libraries
This notebook uses several Python packages that come standard with the Anaconda Python distribution. The primary libraries that are used here are:
*	`NumPy`: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.
*	`Pandas`: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.
*	`Scikit-learn`: The essential Machine Learning package in Python.
*	`Keras` :A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, enabling fast experimentation.
*	`Matplotlib`: Basic plotting library in Python; most other Python plotting libraries are built on top of it.

packages used
`conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib keras`
